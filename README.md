# Materials_Characerisation_MATLAB
Matlab scripts for the plotting of various laboratory experimental data in physics,chemistry/material science. 
Scripts are not perfect in any way, they are to be used as a stepping stone in developing your own scripts or as a quick way to plot something if you are not very familiar with Matlab.
There is much improvement work to be done, as some of the functions the scripts rely on are quite old and need updating. 

The characterisation techniques included are: 
1. Raman (handles .csv and .txt files)
2. XRD (handles .csv and .xye files)
3. XPS (needs data to be correctly formatted) - still not uploaded
